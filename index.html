            <p class="general_title">We Know Sorting Waste Is Not Easy</p>
            <p class="general_p">In the US, every year <b>22 million tons</b> of household recyclables go to landfills, become litter, and pollute our waters.
                <br>
                While packaging plays a key role in keeping products safe and transportable, it too often is discarded when it could be
                used again. Recycling protects resources from depletion, allows communities to manage the amount of trash they have to
                handle, and protects the environment by saving water and greenhouse gases. In America, our capture rate of household
                recycables is about 50 percent. Those recyclables that escape translate to $1.8 billion lost in addition to the wasted
                water, and energy.
                <br>
                Most Americans donâ€™t realize how much recyclables they throw out when they could be recycled.
